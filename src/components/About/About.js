                    <p>I'm Sophia and I am a full-stack web developer with experience managing project teams and GitHub work flow. I graduated from the University of Washington in 2020 with a B.S. in Applied Physics. I am comfortable with both back-end and front-end work and always welcome the opportunity to learn from any challenge!<br/><br/>If I'm not coding, you can find me with my nose in a good book, spending time with my dogs, listening to music, playing the piano, or tinkering with my PC build!<br/><br/>I am passionate about working with people and would love to help you turn your next big idea into a reality!</p>
